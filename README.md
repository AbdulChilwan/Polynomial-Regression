This project is written in python and uses polynomial regression. Training and testing data is given then plotted on a graph.
The relationship I have modeled was the amount of salary earned (per month)
as a mobile developer based on years of experience.
algorithm used for training set: y = 2(x)**2+x+3
x = years of experience
y = money earned (in rands) in thousands
